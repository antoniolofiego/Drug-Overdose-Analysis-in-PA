# Drug Overdose Analysis in Pennsylvania
An exploration and analysis of an openly available overdose dataset from Open Data Pennsylvania. Includes data cleaning, EDA, modeling and model interpretation through SHAP.

## Impact of opioids in Pennsylvania

In 2017, the state of Pennsylvania had a population of 12.79 Million and:
- Had an estimated loss in wages due to opioid use of $2.6 billion representing a loss of $81 million in state tax revenue
- 2 out of 100  people suffered from a drug use disorder and over 10,700 deaths are attributed to overdose cases
- Over 3,100 babies were born with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome and over 3,200 children were removed from their home due to parental drug use 

## Enter opioid antagonist

Opioids can cause difficulty breathing, sedation, potentially resulting in death. Opioid antagonist bind to opioid receptors and can reverse and block the effects of other opioids.

Opioid antidotes such as Naloxone, also known as Narcan, are medications that reverses opioid effects. Naloxone acts in 2-5 minutes. If the person doesn’t wake in 5 minutes, subsequent doses should be given. 

## What we want to achieve?

Identified by the state of Pennsylvania as one of the worst public health crisis in a generation, the opioid epidemic has far reaching economic and personal effects.  Given a two-year data set on overdose cases and survival rates in the state, identify drug usage, overdose and survival rate trends in order to recognize survival factor significance and to support future research to improve overdose survival and resource support.  

## Research Questions: 
- Is this data set, in its current structure, adequate to develop a useful prediction model for drug overdose and survival rates. 
- Identify interaction with drugs and geographic areas and potential local/community specific efforts underlying the data (identified by significantly higher survival rates).
- What factors are effective in increasing overdose survival rate odds.
